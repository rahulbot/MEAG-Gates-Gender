But the NYU researchers discovered several loopholes that allowed Facebook pages that had bought more than 350,000 political ads, worth at least $37 million, to avoid ever having to disclose who was behind them. That represented 54.6 percent of all Facebook pages whose ads were included in the company's online register of political messages . The dollar figure is an estimate and may be higher because Facebook does not publish the exact figures spent on online ads across its platforms. Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Facebook imposed rules that required political advertisers to include a message on all paid-for posts, disclosing who was behind them. The goal was to allow voters to understand which groups were targeting them on social media. The company also created an online register of all political ads, though the database remains difficult to access and fails to capture all paid-for messages bought by political campaigners. It often does not immediately know when partisan ads run on its global platforms, according to the NYU research. To analyze how actors were buying political messages on Facebook and Instagram, Edelson and her co-authors, Damon McCoy and Tobias Lauinger, created a database of all available paid-for messages that had run on the company's platforms in the U.S. for 13 months ending on June 1, 2019. The researchers incorporated the company's own ad library with an independent dataset pulled directly from Facebook's online database of political ads. The NYU academics then combined all ads from the same buyer to avoid duplication, cross-referenced their dataset with Facebook's records and tracked how long it took the social network to add undisclosed political ads to its ad library. The research represents the largest effort, so far, to determine how successful Facebook has been in meeting Zuckerberg's promises to clamp down on the worst offenders, including potential foreign actors targeting the upcoming U.S. presidential election and elsewhere. Facebook found it difficult to keep up with the pace of stealth political activity on its network, according to the NYU research. During the 13-month research period, for instance, the academics said that the number of partisan paid-for messages whose backers were not disclosed did not decline, despite Facebook’s multimillion-dollar investments targeted at those who tried to circumvent its systems. Among the groups that repeatedly did not disclose their political affiliations were several U.S. government agencies, as well as Xinhua News, the media outlet owned by the Chinese government. Despite Facebook outlawing such foreign spending on ads connected to domestic U.S. political topics, Xinhua News spent at least $16,600 on 51 undisclosed political ads, based on the NYU data.
